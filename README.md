# Opiate-Datamining-Project

## Overview

This is a data mining project done by Matthew Donald, Brandon Broadstone and Samuel Thomas to demonstrate our knowledge in data mining concepts such as classification and clustering. The dataset that was anazlyzed contained the total amount of opiate sales in Lee county, sepeerated in columns based on certain attributes such as city, drug name, dosage and location of the sale in the form of a .csv file. 

## Instructions 

To run the program please follow the steps below:

1. Download the zip file and unzip it to any location that is easily accesible
2. Remove "drive.mount('/content/drive')" from line 6 of the Python code (if you are running this on Google Colab keep this line and place the .csv in your google drive)
3. Replace "opiateCSV = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/My Drive/DataMining/arcos-fl-lee-12071-itemized.csv")" with the file location of your .csv
4. Run the code!

## Possible problems

1. Because our project was coded entirely on Google Colab, the output on the console may look messy, We recomend using the .pynb file and uploading it through google drive which will make the code retain its original look and formatting
